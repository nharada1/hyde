<p>Why?</p>

<ul>
  <li>Discover</li>
  <li>Predict</li>
  <li>Manage</li>
  <li>Treat</li>
</ul>

<p>Take atrial fibrillation for example. Almost 300,000 people die a year, but we can implant a defibrillator to revive them. However, who do we implant into? This is what we want to answer. This class will focus on using predictive data analysis to supplement medicine.</p>

<p>Overview of biomedical decision system:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Acquisition</li>
  <li>Representation</li>
  <li>Manipulation</li>
  <li>Analysis</li>
  <li>Visualization</li>
</ul>

<p>Class consists of three homeworks and a large project. Each project group will work with a mentor to guide them along their work. </p>

        Agents and Rationality
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">04 Sep 2014</span>

    <h2 id="agents">Agents</h2>
<p>An agent is anything that acts on its environment and perceives its environment. Sensing is required, so a windup toy isn’t an agent. Agents also must pursue a set of pre-specified goals.</p>

<p><strong>Percepts</strong> - The perceptual inputs at any time</p>

<p><strong>Percept sequence</strong> - The history of everything an agent has perceived</p>

<p>Agents actions can only depend on things it perceives. Note that this can include non-states such as a <em>lack</em> of a wall.</p>

<p><strong>Agent function</strong> - Maps percepts to actions, what we’ll focus on</p>

<p><strong>Agent program</strong> - Implementation</p>

<p>We must somehow evaluate an Agent’s behavior. The answer generally depends on the task environment. Since rationality depends on the agent’s capabilities, we can say a rational agent tries to maximize a performance measure with respect to its capabilities and prior knowledge.</p>

<p>Learning is considered a part of rationality - you must learn to be rational.</p>

<p>Exam note: Proper definition of rationality will be on the exam.</p>

<p>Rationality - For each possible percept sequence, a rational agent should select an action that is expected to maximize its performance measure, given the evidence provided by the percept sequence and whatever built-in knowledge the agent has.</p>

<h2 id="task-environment">Task Environment</h2>
<p>Task environments have seven different properties.</p>

<h4 id="fully-vs-partially-observable">Fully vs Partially Observable</h4>
<p>Can an agent see everything in the environment? If fully observable, there’s no internal state needed because we can see everything.</p>

<h4 id="singe-agent-vs-multiagent">Singe Agent vs Multiagent</h4>
<p>Multiagent environments mean that an there is another agent that impacts you.</p>

<h4 id="deterministic-vs-stochastic">Deterministic vs Stochastic</h4>
<p>Deterministic means we can predict perfectly the state of the world. In practice almost every environment is stochastic.</p>

<h4 id="episodic-vs-sequential">Episodic vs Sequential</h4>
<p>Episodic results in independent events - previous action doesn’t impact the now.</p>

<h4 id="static-vs-dynamic">Static vs Dynamic</h4>
<p>Dynamic means that the environment changes <em>while</em> the agent is thinking. </p>

<h4 id="discrete-vs-continuous">Discrete vs Continuous</h4>
<p>Refers to the way time is handled. Straightforward, same idea as DSP or control theory. Interesting idea, chess is discrete, but chess with a clock is continuous.</p>

<h4 id="known-vs-unknown">Known vs Unknown</h4>
<p>A known environment means that the agent knows the rules of the environment going in.</p>

<h2 id="agent-structure">Agent Structure</h2>
<p>An agent consists of its architecture and program. </p>

<p>A few model types of agents:</p>

<p><strong>Stateless</strong> - Effects of time aren’t modeled</p>

<p><strong>Fixed Model</strong> - Designer provides model, contrast to <strong>learning model</strong> where the agent can adapt.</p>

<p>A few planning types of agents:</p>

<p><strong>Reflexive</strong> - Actions based on preprogrammed conditions</p>

<p><strong>Predictive</strong> - Actions based on potential effects</p>

<h4 id="table-driven-agent">Table-Driven Agent</h4>
<p>Agents choose actions based on states, explicit structure. This is based on percept sequences, which grows large quickly. Table driven <em>must</em> look at all states, including all past states.</p>

<h4 id="simple-reflex-agent">Simple-Reflex Agent</h4>
<p>Similar to table driven, but based on what we see <em>right now</em>. This is a quite simple structure, and in partially observable worlds we can’t make correct decisions.</p>

    <span class="post-date">03 Sep 2014</span>

    <p>Course will cover advanced database topics. You’re expected to come in with basic database knowledge (which I don’t have). Course will also consist of paper readings. Everyone will sign up for a paper to present and must meet with instructor for feedback a week before actually presenting.</p>

<p>Student presentations begin on Tuesday Sept 16, which is really soon. Reviews for each week are due Monday before class at midnight.</p>

    <h2 id="what-is-ai">What is AI?</h2>
<p>The main four quadrants of AI, although we mostly deal with the last two in this class:</p>

<h4 id="thinking-human">Thinking Human</h4>
<p>We can learn about our mind, but assessment is hard because <strong>we</strong> don’t know everything about human thought. </p>

<h4 id="acting-human">Acting Human</h4>
<p>Generally assessed via Turing test but really this just proves a machine can trick us. Helps us learn about human behavior and let’s us make people more sympathetic to agents.</p>

<h4 id="thinking-rationally">Thinking Rationally</h4>
<p>Logic provides a strong formal framework for knowledge, but many times it’s hard to translate ideas into concrete logic or formulas.</p>

<h4 id="acting-rationally">Acting Rationally</h4>
<p>We want to make the best decision given uncertainty; we do this by maximizing some metric.</p>

<h2 id="history-of-ai">History of AI</h2>
<p>Much of AI’s history is based on philosophy. Eventually the field drew in formal mathematics, along with other fields such as economics. </p>

<h2 id="notes-about-this-class">Notes about this class</h2>
<p>General and large survey course, won’t cover machine learning or acting human in depth. Six problem sets, programming is in <strong>C++</strong> only. Class has one midterm subject to change and one final on December 17th.</p>

    <p>EECS 584 will cover a number of advanced topics in big data, databases, and modern data-intensive systems. The specific topics include advanced concurrency control techniques, query processing and optimization strategies for relational database systems, advanced indexing methods, parallel and distributed database systems, map-reduce/hadoop, NoSQL, database-as-a-service (DB clouds), data mining on large databases, data on the web, and topics in database security and privacy.</p>

<p>In addition to learning about advanced topics in databases, this course will also give you the opportunity to practice important research skills:</p>

<ul>
  <li>You will gain experience reading and critically evaluating original research papers.You will gain experience reading and critically evaluating original research papers.</li>
  <li>You will practice communicating complex technical material, both orally and in written form.</li>
  <li>You will complete a small-scale original research project of your own choosing.</li>
</ul>

<p>The prerequisite for this course is EECS 484, equivalent coursework, or permission from the instructor.</p>
