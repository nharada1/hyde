## Minimal Spanning Tree
Trying to show that starting with the antiset and adding safe edges is correct. This is proving that a greedy algorithm is optimal. Suppose T is a MST that contains A. In T there is a path between A and B. We want to pick an f that is on the path. We pick a greedy edge, so weight(f) >= weight(e). Now we remove f and add e. We are trying to make the greedy algorithm look like the optimal one. This is in the book.

Prim: Grow a tree by adding in new edges over and over.
Kruskal: Grow a forest by adding together subsets of forests.

What are running times? We need to ensure we aren't creating cycles. Time is $$\Theta(E \log V)$$. For Kruskal we want the minimum weight among all edges that doesn't create a cycle. Chapter 21 shows a data structure for this.
