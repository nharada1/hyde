This lecture is actually more about first order logic.

## Inference in FOL
**Universal instantiation** is the idea that we can infer any sentence obtained by substituting a *ground term* for the variable. If we replace a variable by a single new constant it's called **existential instantiation** and we replace a variable with a single constant. 

**First order inference** allows us to substitute names for variables, and we can apply this many times over many sentences. This brings us to **unification**, which allows us to find the values of variables to make a sentence logically consistent. 

How do we resolve first order logical statements? We can look at chaining again. Let's look first at **forward chaining**:

In forward chaining we want to apply logic iteratively until we reach a conclusion. However, this is quite inefficient, if intuitive. We recheck each rule each iteration which is a huge waste. There's a version that's efficient, but we won't discuss it.

Obviously the other option of this is **backward chaining**, which is basically just using depth first search. 

## Resolution
Resolution requires conjunctive normal form!
