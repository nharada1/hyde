## More Probability

### Marginal Distributions
$$ P(Y) = \sum\limits_{z \in Z} P(Y, z) $$

We can sum over parts of the over distribution to determine specific attributes. 

### Independence
Independent variables mean that the occurence one event tells you nothing about the occurence of another.

### Bayes Theorem
$$ P(a|b) = \frac{P(b|a)P(a)}{P(b)} $$

### Conditional Independence
$$ P(X,Y|Z) = P(X|Z)P(Y|Z) $$

## Bayesian Networks
In a Bayesian network we assume conditional independence to create our distribution. By using the product rule we'll be able to build a model of probabilities and we can infer results from the network.
