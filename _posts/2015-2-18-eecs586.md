## Scheduling
For activities that may overlap, find a set that don't. First option is to build an interval tree, this is $$\Theta(n \log n)$$ but not always correct. Second is to build a graph and solve the graph using a topological sort. This is $$\Theta(n^2)$$ but is always correct.

Can we do better?

How to we compare greedy and non-greedy algorithms? We want to try and force the non-greedy solution to look like ours. Chapter 16.

What if we don't generate the graph explicitly? We need to keep track of when shorter events finish in a sweep. Check out the augmented tree chapter to see the sweep line technique in other problems.

## Graphs - Chapter 23
More greedy algorithms. Note: we can represent a graph as an edge list or an adjacency matrix. Be careful if you give a time for an algorithm -- what's your input. For an adj list it takes time to answer queries. More notes: using V when we mean absolute value of V is a trip up. 

Traveling salesman problem: We have an acyclic graph and a set of roads. We want to find a subset of roads that connect all the cities with minimal cost. We'll assume that weights are positive. There exists a generic greedy approach for finding the minimum spanning tree. This is the major way to do it. Given S, an edge E is a "safe" edge if S set of edges is in some MST and S union e set of edges in some MST.

A cut is a partition of verticies in V1, V2 so that S < V1.
