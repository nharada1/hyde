## Naive Bayes
Classifier that assumes conditional independence and uses Bayes' rule to make classifications. Remember Bayes' rule:

$$ p(C_k \vert \mathbf{x}) = \frac{p(C_k) \ p(\mathbf{x} \vert C_k)}{p(\mathbf{x})} $$

We'll draw our distribution from a Bernoulli or Multinomial distribution. With independence assumptions, the conditional distribution over class C is:

$$ p(C_k \vert x_1, \dots, x_n) = \frac{1}{Z} p(C_k) \prod_{i=1}^n p(x_i \vert C_k) $$
