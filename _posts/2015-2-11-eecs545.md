## Gaussian Processes
A Gaussian process is a probability distribution over functions y(x), such that the set of values of y(x) evaluated jointly have a Guassian distribution. What determines a GP? A mean function, a covariance function, and that's all. Normally we say the mean is zero, so the prior is represented by the kernel entirely. 

Linear regression, and Gaussian processes. Bayesian linear regression is just a special instance of a Guassian process. Features in Bayesian LR are kernel functions in GPs.

**Fix this**
$$y(x) = w^T \phi(x)$$ with a weight prior $$p(w) = N(w \mid 0, $$

A Gaussian process will generate data from its parameters (plus noise) but how do we actually learn one of these processes? We can find the next covariance given the current data. The predictive distribution is a Gaussian whose mean and variance depend on X(n+1). Try and ifnd a correspondence between GP and linear regression on your own time.
