## Convex Hulls
We have some points in two space. This is **Graham Scan**. We want to find extreme points of convex hull. Start with a point guaranteed to be extreme. Take rightmost, lowest point. Sort remaining points by angle relative to start. Each time we reach one add it to a list of tentative extreme points. Test convexity a point at a time and remove non-convex points. When we remove a point we must check the ONE previous point until we hit an okay point. Time is O(n log n) based on amortized analysis. In this analysis, we must charge a point when we delete it.

For **Jarvis' March**, we again start with the bottom left point. Note that the smallest angle *must* be an extreme point. Now we move from extreme point to extreme point, going around in a circle until all of our extreme points are added. This is O(nh) time where n is the number of points and h is the number of extreme points. 

If we're given the points of each polygon in order, we can find the convex hull in O(P1+P2). 

We can also do a divide and conquer method for finding the convex hull. Divide the middle and combine the two by finding the secant lines that are invalid and removing them. Why do this? In higher dimensions. 

Expected case with IID points? Jarvis' march is fairly slow, but divide and conquer is faster expected.
