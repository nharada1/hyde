## Hardness
A problem is NP-Hard if giving a polynomial time algorithm for it shows that P=NP. Say you wanna solve an NP-hard problem? Now what?

1. Maybe you have a small number of instances
2. Maybe some parameters are fixed
3. Maybe it's easy for special cases of interest
4. Maybe you only care about the expected case
5. Maybe you only need a close approximation

How do we know when special cases are easy? Who knows?

## Expected Case Analysis
For expected case we need to know the probability distribution. 

Hamiltonian cycles: recall that it's a cycle through all verticies where we don't repeat any of them. Problem: for every pair of vertices, we add an edge with probability p. As n verticies goes to infinity, the probability of having a Hamiltonian cycle goes to 1. In 1987, Gurerich and Shiloch proved that you can find a Hamiltonian cycle or prove that non exists in expected O(n) time in this specific case.

In many cases the NP part of the problem won't be reached in the expected case if the distribution you're working with is right.
