## Finish up constraints

### Forward Checking
We can reduce our search by forward checking - whenever a variable X is assigned we examine each unassigned Y and delete Y that doesn't fit constraints. Forward checking is good, but we don't actually look ahead to all of our constraints; FC is almost a greedy search.

If we maintain arc consistency, we'll be more stringent and search space is even smaller. 

### Backjumping
The way we knew in the 4queen problem in notes on where to restart is because we knew where to backjump. To do this we'll create a conflict set containing the past conflicts.

## Logic
We want to be able to reason about the world in a way that lets us derive new facts about the world without full knowledge. In the logical framework we'll have a knowledge base, and we want to augment and query it somehow. As an example of logic, we'll introduce wumpus world:

*An agent runs through the maze, avoiding the wumpus and pits, while looking for gold. Additionally, the agent can shoot the wumpus (but only has one arrow).*

In this world the agent can perceive things in adjacent squares to objects. World is discrete, static, single-agent, sequential, partially observable (arrow and wumpus states are not given by world). We'll cover more next week.
