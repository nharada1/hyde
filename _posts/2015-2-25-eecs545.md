A bayesian network cannot always be represented by a Markov network. Every joint distribution can be represented by a directed OR undirected graphical model. 

## Inference in Graphical Models
We can marginalize probabilities to do inference in graphical models. Remember from AI, we want to move around summations by using the graphical structure to minimize calculation. 

## Factor graphs
The factor graph is the combination of various "factors" that let us represent a DAG in a more compact way. It's not unique, but allows us to do inference by representing probabilities in a less parametric form.
