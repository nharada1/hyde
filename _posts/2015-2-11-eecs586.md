## Different Types of Optimizing
* NP-hard: Try every possible solution
* Dynamic Programming: Try everything but do it efficiently
* Greedy: Don't try everything

## Optimal Binary Search
Given keys and probabilities in advance. Our first try is an exhaustive search: just try everything. Obviously that sucks. We could also try a quick-sortish method where we find the optimal tree on smaller trees until the base case. This is better, but not optimal -- we've already seen many of the trees we create. We are solving subproblems repeatedly. We need to *memoize* our values we've seen. This is a key part of dynamic programming.
