## Reviewing the Homework
Only thing of note is that number 2 is not divide and conquer, we can skip by k instead and end up with an algorithm with identical efficiency. Goddamn that's easier than divide and conquer.

To find the lower bound:

I didn't catch this, go in and ask Quentin or TA.

## Quicksort
Overview of quicksort:

We set a pivot point, then split into parts above and below that pivot. Then we sort those by quicksort. Do this by swaps.

### Worst Case
Partition is linear. Worst case of actual sort is in the case that one partition is the whole list (ie X is the largest or smallest value) and then we have $$\Theta(n^2)$$. Note this assumption requires convexity of quicksort! This means that having one big piece is ALWAYS same/worse than two pieces made from that big piece. 

### Best Case
Partitions are exactly half. This means $$\Theta(n \log n)$$. 

### Expected Case
We'll say that all input orderings are equally likely and no duplicates. Expected comparisons:

$$\sum_{i=1}^{n-1} \sum_{j=i+1}^n$$ prob that ki and kj are compared. This is only if ki and kj are pivots.

Also note that book picks pivot by choosing the rightmost element. Pick the middle! Or we can sample the distribution and find the median and choose that one.

## Order Statistics (Ch 9)
The order statistic is the ith item when the items are sorted (basically). We'll just pick the lower median. 

Median: n/2 statistic
