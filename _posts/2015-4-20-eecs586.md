## Exam
No books, no electronics. Can bring one 8.5x11 sheet of paper with anything written on two sides. Will post last year's final.

## Homework

1. Subset sum reduces. If bounded by B there are BE possibilities which is polynomial. Apparently?
2. Ham-Path to One-Longer can be done by adding a path p in addition to a Hamiltonian cycle, which makes it easy. Basically we just ignore path p.
3. Reduces from independent set to nearly independent set. Adds additional vertices that allow us to sum to the weight properly.
4. Same as ours. There is a divide and conquer method for this where were remove larger sections at once. We can get $\Theta(N*m \log m)$.
