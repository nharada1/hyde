## Types of Graph Structures
Last time we talked about tail to tail models. This time we discuss "head to tail" relationships. In head to tail we see a->c->b. We can use this knowledge to show conditional independence:

$$ P(a,b \mid c) = \frac{P(a,b,c)}{P(c)} = p(b \mid c)p(a \mid c) $$

Which shows conditional independence between a and b.

## Inference by enumeration

$$ P(X \mid e) = \alpha P(X,e) = \alpha \sum\limits_y P(X,e,y) $$

Where $$\alpha = \frac{1}{P(e)}$$. We sum over the hidden variables so introduce them into our equation.

Computationally this enumeration is hard because we must sum over so many variables. 

## Variable Elimination
Given a bunch of components we want to evaluate from the right to left side so we don't waste calculation. This is online.
