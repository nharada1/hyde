title: Negative Edges in Search
category: eecs586
---
Negative edges are less common, but in Dijkstra's algorithm we won't be able to keep track of the best possible choice at each step (because edges can be negative and thus actually improve our score moving outwards). How do we fix it? We can use Bellman-Ford to search instead. This algorithm relaxes **all** edges, not just the best looking ones. Unfortunately this can result in an infinite running time if we have a negative cycle. We'll need to keep track of these negative cycles or we're screwed.
