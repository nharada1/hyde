## Computational Medicine
Why?

* Discover
* Predict
* Manage
* Treat

Take atrial fibrillation for example. Almost 300,000 people die a year, but we can implant a defibrillator to revive them. However, who do we implant into? This is what we want to answer. This class will focus on using predictive data analysis to supplement medicine.

Overview of biomedical decision system:

* Acquisition
* Representation
* Manipulation
* Analysis
* Visualization

Class consists of three homeworks and a large project. Each project group will work with a mentor to guide them along their work.
