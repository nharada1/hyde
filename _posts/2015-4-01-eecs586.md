## NP-complete
We say A is NP-complete if 

* $$ A \in NP $$
* $$ B \leq_p A \exists B \in NP $$

We can say C is NP-complete if

* $$ C \in NP $$
* There is an NP-complete D s.t. $$D \leq_p C$$

## Version of Satisfiability
U is a set of boolean variables and a literal is either u or not u. A clause is a set of literals. A clause is satisfied if one of the literals is true. A collection of clauses is satisfied if there is a truth assignment that satisfies all the clauses. 

In 3-SAT the clauses only have 3 literals. It turns out we can reduce many problems into a 3-SAT problem.
