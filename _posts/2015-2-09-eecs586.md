## Red Black Trees
Red black trees are always balanced by nature. For red black tree insertion we generally need to rotate trees. 

## Problem for Freshman
We want a BST with insert, delete, search, and search by rank (order statistic). By order statistic, something like "find the 17th key". Once we have the count and the tree constructed, the second two become trivial. We want insert and delete. We can use "augmented trees" where the trees have a count at each node. When we rotate, we update each node with the count of the child nodes. This additional operation is supported by the augment, and we can still insert and delete in log(n) time. 

To update the count of each node, we only require two rotations at most during insertion, and we can compute size attributes in constant time, so insertion is lg(n) because insertion is just lg(n). Deletion is similar, reqiring only 3 rotations at most and is again lg(n). Doing augmentaion like this changes our indexing, and changes which query is efficient. We'll also look at interval trees, read the book for this one.
