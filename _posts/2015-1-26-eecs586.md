## Master Theorem
Three cases for theorem, intuition says:

* $$a=b$$ means each layer does about as much work as the previous
* $$a \lt b$$ means each layer does less work
* $$a \gt b$$ means each layer does more work

Review the book and notes, because there are fringe cases where we can't actually apply the theorem.

## Heapsort
Uses a heap to maintain data, and reads from heap (which is sorted by definition) to sort. In a heap:

$$ A(i) \geq A(2i) $$

$$ A(i) \geq A(2i+1) $$

Maximum element at the root as a result of these local properties. 

Why are all these algorithms n log n? We want a lower bound on comparison based sort (remember no assumptions about the data, just comparison.) The intuition is the binary result of sorting algorithms creates the lg bounds. Two different inital sorted orders can't end up at the same leaf, so the number of leaves must be >= number of initial input orderings. There are n! input orderings. For tree height h # of leaves $$\leq 2^h$$, we need:

$$2^h \geq n!$$ and $$h \geq \log n!$$

$$ h \geq \sum_{i=1}^n \log i $$ 

so the lower bound is

$$ \Theta(n \log n) $$

What about the expected case? We can convert trees to each other while retaining leaf number and depth will differ by only one. Average case is $$\Theta(n \log n)$$.
