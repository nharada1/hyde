In this short paper, the authors provide a quick look at the rapid development of big science and the need for databases to support scientific applications. They point out that while in the past scientists would keep a lab notebook of observations, modern scientific toolchains require complex data analysis and terabytes of actual storage. They (correctly in my opinion) point out that the problem is compouding, increasing at an exponential rate as scientists become more familiar with software and hardware simultaneously drops in cost. The strong technical point of this article is the idea that datacubes can provide the analytic power that scientists expect on an interactive timescale for larger sets of data. I agree this is likely true, but I think that in many cases scientists don't want to commit to learning one of the many databases that's available, and would rather learn a standard. I think if a standard is accepted that would be great for the science community. It seems that Matlab and more recently Python tend to be computational standards in science. We will see if a database steps up, and if Hadoop comes out on top due to its wide adoption and low cost.
