## Closest Pairs
How do we find closest pairs in 2d? Use the same algorithm as for 1d. As we raise the number of dimensions we'll have to raise the number of neighbors we look at, but it'll still be O(n) because the neighbors are fixed. What if we want the problem analysis in terms of d and n? 

$$\Omega(3^d n)$$
$$\Theta(d3^d n)$$

So this is O(n) where the implied constants are a function of d. 

In 2d what is the worst case? If we split into two parts, the middle needs to be examined. If we divide a space into patches of delta, then were are no more than 5 points in that space (in 2d).
