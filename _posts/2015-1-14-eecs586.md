## Caching
For move to front: What is the asymptotic number of expected keys encountered in a search?

$$ 1 + \sum_{i=1}^{n} p_i \sum_{j \dne i}\frac{p_j}{p_i+p_j} $$

Where pi is the probability of request k_i, and the second term is the prob that kj is in front of ki.

For transposition caching: We'll assume n is more than 2 and that all probabilities are not the same. R.Rivset proved that transposition has a lower expected number of items examined than MTF does.

In either case, we can represent the state space as a markov chain and take it to steady state to find expected number of items. There are two major methods of analyzing sequential search algorithms: probabilistically or via amortization. 

Amortized Analysis of Self-Organizing Sequential Search Heuristics:

There is a sequence of requests, and the optimal ordering is order of decreasing m value. In this analysis we will not go to infinity.
