## What is AI?
The main four quadrants of AI, although we mostly deal with the last two in this class:

#### Thinking Human
We can learn about our mind, but assessment is hard because **we** don't know everything about human thought. 

#### Acting Human
Generally assessed via Turing test but really this just proves a machine can trick us. Helps us learn about human behavior and let's us make people more sympathetic to agents.

#### Thinking Rationally
Logic provides a strong formal framework for knowledge, but many times it's hard to translate ideas into concrete logic or formulas.

#### Acting Rationally
We want to make the best decision given uncertainty; we do this by maximizing some metric.

## History of AI
Much of AI's history is based on philosophy. Eventually the field drew in formal mathematics, along with other fields such as economics. 

## Notes about this class
General and large survey course, won't cover machine learning or acting human in depth. Six problem sets, programming is in **C++** only. Class has one midterm subject to change and one final on December 17th.
