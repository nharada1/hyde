Course will cover advanced database topics. You're expected to come in with basic database knowledge (which I don't have). Course will also consist of paper readings. Everyone will sign up for a paper to present and must meet with instructor for feedback a week before actually presenting.

Student presentations begin on Tuesday Sept 16, which is really soon. Reviews for each week are due Monday before class at midnight.
