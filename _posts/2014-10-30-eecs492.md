## Continue Less Real Planning
Defining the search problem:

Initial state, actions avail, resulting state. This is backwards search as applied to a planning graph instead of a search tree. In GraphPlan finding a solution is intractable in the worst case, so we need heuristics to guide action selection. Also, this tells us nothing about timing.

## Scheduling
Up until now we've been assuming everything takes one time step. How do we solve scheduling? We'll use the **critical path method**. In this way, a critical path is one that has the earliest start and end times for each action. Think critical path from business scheduling.

The path goes through a graph, a partial order plan, and a linearly ordered sequence of actions. For each action off the critical path, we have some slack time. We want to calculate early start and late start for each action. In this new model we can represent variables in our sentences. 

Partially observable environments add complexity: during planning we need a model of sensors. The agent has to reason in real time while executing the plan. We'lll introduce a thing called 'percept schema' that augments the percepts from PDDL.
