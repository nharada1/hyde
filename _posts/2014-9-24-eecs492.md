## Generic Best First
Start with a queue, pop the most promising node according to f. If n is a goal node, return it otherwise add successors. The choice of f changes the search algorithm.

We'll say each node has a few attributes:

* Depth
* g - Actual path cost from root to here
* h - Estimated cost from this node to goal

So how to do choose f?

* BFS: f = depth
* DFS: f = 0-depth
* UCS: f = g
* GBFS: f = h
* A-star: f = g+h
