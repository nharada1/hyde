## Some more Stats
Covariance relates variance of multiple random variables. Remember that all the information of a Gaussian is contained in its exponential term. Covariance is a positive definite symmetric matrix.

**Central Limit Theorem** - The distribution of sum of N independent and identically distributed random variables approaches a normal distribution.

## Decision Analysis
Rational agents maximize utility - utility captures preferences. We need to formalize utility:

P(Result=s' | a,e) is the probability of an outcome s' given evidence e.

We also want to define a utility function U(s) that captures the agent's preferences (this is a single number). Additionally we want the expected utility of an action, which we can define as:

$$ EU(a \mid e) = \sum P(Result(a) = s' \mid a,\textbf{e})U(s') $$
