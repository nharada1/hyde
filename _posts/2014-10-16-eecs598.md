How do we model expected outcomes? We can predict either binary or continuously.

## Binary Methods
A - True Positive
B - False Negative
C - False Negative
D - True Negative

#### Accuracy
Proportion of cases predicted correctly. Rarely used in real systems.
$$ \frac{A+D}{A+B+C+D} $$

#### Recall
Sensitivity, or how well we predict true positives compared to false negatives
$$ \frac{A}{A+B} $$

#### Specificity
How well we distingish between negatives and false positives
$$ \frac{D}{C+D} $$

#### Precision
Positive predictive value
$$ \frac{A}{A+C} $$

#### Negative predictive power
$$ \frac{D}{D+B} $$

#### Relative Risk
How likely an outcome is relative to the alternative
$$ \frac{A/(A+C)}{B/(B+D)} $$

#### Odds ratio
Odds of actual predictions, does not change based on positive or negative outcomes
$$ \frac{A/C}{B/D} $$

## Continuous Methods
Gives a somewhat better model

#### AUC - Operating Curve
Lets us see the values at different decision thresholds, generally widely used.

#### Hosmer-Lemeshow Test
Check to see if observed outcomes and predicted outcomes match, but can be fooled by larger samples.
$$ \sum\limits_{i=1}^n \frac{(O_i - E_i)^2}{E_i(1-E_i/n_i)} $$

## Comparing Two Systems
How can we compare two systems to each other? Well we could just use the metrics we've already discussed. We have other systems though:

#### Net Reclassification Improvement (NRI)
Focuses on binary predictors, and looks at how system B treats observations differently. This gives us a sense of how many patients will be affected by improvements.

#### Integrated Discrimination Improvement (IDI)
Compares differences in discrimination slopes, aka differences of mean of probabilities for outcome vs non-outcome.
