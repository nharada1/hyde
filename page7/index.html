    <h2 id="network-parameterization">Network Parameterization</h2>
<p>Explaining away: when you have two causes for a symptom and one cause is true, the belief that the other cause is true goes down. This is the heart of inference and is intuitive. </p>

<p>D-separation: If all paths from A to B are blocked, A is d-separated from B by C. If A is d-separated from B to C, the joint distribution over all variables in the graph are A dep B given C.</p>

<p>Markov Blanket: A set S is a Markov blanket if if X is conditionally independent of all other vars given S. We must include all children, parents, and parents of children. We need to include parents of children because otherwise we could feed through head to head knowledge by changing the co-parent.</p>

<p>Noisy-OR Parameterization: In context of diseases: for every disease you have the prob of you not having a symptom goes down by a multiplicative amount. We claim this is a compact version of the conditional prob tables.</p>

<h2 id="hidden-markov-models">Hidden Markov Models</h2>
<p><strong>Exam Question</strong>: Given a diagram write down the joint probability (slide 55).</p>

<h2 id="markov-random-fields">Markov Random Fields</h2>
<p>A clique is a set of nodes connected to its neighbors. A maximal clique means the nodes are fully connected. If our intuition is about causality, then we want a directed graph. If there isn’t a causal intuition, then we can go for an undirected graph. To convert directed to undirected graphs we need to ‘moralize’ the graph by marrying the parents.</p>

    <h2 id="scheduling">Scheduling</h2>
<p>For activities that may overlap, find a set that don’t. First option is to build an interval tree, this is <script type="math/tex">\Theta(n \log n)</script> but not always correct. Second is to build a graph and solve the graph using a topological sort. This is <script type="math/tex">\Theta(n^2)</script> but is always correct.</p>

<p>Can we do better?</p>

<p>How to we compare greedy and non-greedy algorithms? We want to try and force the non-greedy solution to look like ours. Chapter 16.</p>

<p>What if we don’t generate the graph explicitly? We need to keep track of when shorter events finish in a sweep. Check out the augmented tree chapter to see the sweep line technique in other problems.</p>

<h2 id="graphs---chapter-23">Graphs - Chapter 23</h2>
<p>More greedy algorithms. Note: we can represent a graph as an edge list or an adjacency matrix. Be careful if you give a time for an algorithm – what’s your input. For an adj list it takes time to answer queries. More notes: using V when we mean absolute value of V is a trip up. </p>

<p>Traveling salesman problem: We have an acyclic graph and a set of roads. We want to find a subset of roads that connect all the cities with minimal cost. We’ll assume that weights are positive. There exists a generic greedy approach for finding the minimum spanning tree. This is the major way to do it. Given S, an edge E is a “safe” edge if S set of edges is in some MST and S union e set of edges in some MST.</p>

<p>A cut is a partition of verticies in V1, V2 so that S &lt; V1. </p>

        Graphical Models

    </h1>

    <h2 id="joint-probability">Joint Probability</h2>
<p>Marginalization is the process of computing total probabilities by summing over the joint probabilities for a given variable. How do we learn and represent these joint probability tables. This is basically graphical models of 492, and will probably be about as fun.</p>

<p>We’ll use the chain rule (many times) for most computations in this section. Remember that:</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display"> P(a,b,c) = p(c \mid a,b)p(b \mid a)p(a) </script>

<p>and et cetera. The directed acyclic graph that this model forms is based on conditional probabilities. A child is conditioned on its parents. A fully connected graph, in an <em>acyclic graph</em>, connects all parents to all their children. If every node is connected to all the others it is no longer acyclic. Ordering in these graphs matters hugely. For notation, we show repeating cycles by boxes in graphical models. Shaded circles are observed. </p>

<p>There are various parameterizations for Bayesian graphs. Overview of parameterizations, we’ve seen all of these in AI. Check the notes for a refresher.</p>

        Cross Validation

    <h2 id="applications-of-ml">Applications of ML</h2>
<p>Two approaches: you can go bottom up or top down. Bottom up is for research and new methods while top down is more for applications. Which way you go is up to you.</p>

<h2 id="bias-variance-tradeoff">Bias Variance Tradeoff</h2>
<p>Variance is how much does the model fit, bias is how well a model fits the data on average. We can view bias as “accuracy” and variance as “precision”. Our expected loss is bias^2 + variance + noise. This is a brilliant decomposition: the expected error is <strong>exactly</strong> these three terms and we can prove it. </p>

<p>This nature of bias and variance means that we generally must choose a tradeoff between the two. Because noise is always present, we have to pick between these parameters. Usually we can find a minima of these terms (especially because bias is squared). In these cases, we usually find that the minimum of the test squared error occurs at this minimum. We find a good balance between the two via cross-validation.</p>

<h2 id="cross-validation">Cross Validation</h2>
<p>Generally the best way to cross validate is to use a train, validation, and test set to avoid overfitting the hyperparameters to the dataset you have. Cross validation is fairly basic - k-Fold or however many folds you want. Leave one out is the same as k-fold if k is n. </p>
