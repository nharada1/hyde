        Classic Optimization
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">11 Nov 2015</span>

    <h2 id="standard-optimizations">Standard Optimizations</h2>
<p>Many optimizations are classic and have been long implemented by compilers</p>

<h3 id="removing-unreachable-code">Removing Unreachable Code</h3>
<p>Many times there is code that can never run. Obviously this should be removed. It turns out that any code that doesn’t influence a store or a branch is removable. This is a simple way to say what should go, but many things influence these two, even indirectly. For example, drawing to the screen is a store. </p>

<h3 id="constant-propagation">Constant Propagation</h3>
<p>We can propagate local constants forward by subbing constants wherever possible instead of registered. We can also use global constant propagation to do this for the whole program. </p>

<h3 id="constant-folding">Constant Folding</h3>
<p>If there is an expression of constants with all literals, we want to do this at compile time. However, there are exceptions! For example, what if the constant expression is impossible. If you want to do <code>3 / 0</code> you need to leave it so that the program fails correctly. You also don’t want to mess with floating point, because the floating point epsilon error is so dependent on the architecture. </p>

<h3 id="forward-copy-propagation">Forward Copy Propagation</h3>
<p>We want to forward propagate the right hand sides of moves to eliminate dependencies and eliminate the move. </p>

<h3 id="common-subexpression-elimination">Common Subexpression Elimination</h3>
<p>We want to save expressions we’ve already evaluated if they’re used again. For example, if a smaller subexpression is used many times we can save a lot of time by evaluating once only. </p>

<h3 id="loop-invariant-code-motion">Loop Invariant Code Motion</h3>
<p>Any instructions that don’t change during the loop can be hoisted out of the loop and calculated once instead of each time. We did this in homework.</p>

<h3 id="global-variable-migration">Global Variable Migration</h3>
<p>Instead of doing a load and a store in a loop repeatedly, we can load and store into a register and then use that register repeatedly in the loop instead. </p>

        Pin Paper
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">14 Oct 2015</span>

    <h2 id="why-pin-is-interesting">Why Pin is interesting</h2>
<p>Pin is essentially a good API version of Dynamo. While Pin is different, for example closed source, it is mostly the same. It does not have a threshold to form traces like Dynamo. It also used to not support AMD processors. </p>

<p>Pin’s JIT goes from one ISA to the same, there’s no IR representation. Only code in the code cache is executed. It’s also important for Pin to change the branch targets of code in the code cache so that Pin doesn’t lose control of the program.</p>

<h2 id="looking-inside-basic-blocks">Looking Inside Basic Blocks</h2>
<p>Things become more complicated when we stop looking at basic blocks like black boxes. We can eliminate instructions, for example, when code is never used (is not live). </p>

        Paper Reviews 1 and 2
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">12 Oct 2015</span>

    <h2 id="dynamo-paper-review">Dynamo Paper Review</h2>
<p>With the rise of object oriented programming and DLLs, it became less beneficial to use static optimization. What were the goals of the Dynamo program?</p>

<ul>
  <li>No user/compiler dependency</li>
  <li>No offline analysis</li>
  <li>Machine independent</li>
  <li>Transparent </li>
</ul>

<p>Dynamo works by identifying hot traces and optimizing those fragments. These fragments are stored in the fragment cache. </p>

    <h2 id="homework-two-overview">Homework Two Overview</h2>
<p>In a loop invariant we can move other parts of the code outside of the loop if they don’t depend on the internal registers. This saves execution because we’ve already stored the value. How to move code? Either move the instructions to the previous block or add a block in between the two blocks. Loop Invariant Code Motion (LICM) moves operations whose source operands don’t change to pre-header. </p>

<p>Reach: Which instructions can reach at a certain place
Available: Which instructions are guaranteed to be a certain value at a location</p>

<p>Homework two is due Oct 23rd, and will be released on Monday. This homework is much harder than number one. Paper reviews are due Monday before class and the reviews are 5\% of the presentation grade.</p>

<h2 id="protean-code">Protean Code</h2>
<p>Why should we revisit dynamic compilation? It was dead for a solid 6 years for native binaries. The motivating context here was datacenters. In a cluster environment there is heavy dynamic change. What do we want to fix? </p>

<p>For example, we can module low priority processes on a server to make room for higher priority processes on the same chip. The typical approach is that we just throttle with napping/sleeping. Insight: the instruction set architecture contains tools that can be leveraged to avoid sleeping (e.g. we can tell an instruction to not access cache NTA hint). By not caching the process we want to throttle, we avoid cache contention at the expense of performance for the slowed application.</p>

<h2 id="deploying-dynamic-compilation">Deploying Dynamic Compilation</h2>
<p>In conventional binary rewriting you have to retain fine grain control at the BB level. Execution <strong>must</strong> come from code in the code cache. Protean code is able to not halt execution while the code is recompiled. Protean is a <strong>compiler</strong> approach which expands the design space for optimization. Weakness: You cannot use an already compiled binary!</p>

<p>During compilation we convert jmp to indirect jmp (which does not actually incur a performance hit). Thus, when you have a runtime compiler, we can rewrite the function pointers to point at a different version. N.B. This runs at a function level. This allows us to optimize functions on the fly while the program is actually running. To properly allow the datacenter to utilize the protean code, we want to select program variants with the right mix of NT cache hint instructions. We want to eliminate or minimize the use of naps/sleeps. </p>
