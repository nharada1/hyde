Hey there! This site serves as an archive for all the notes I take in my classes. While the information may be useful to someone out there, I'm bound to be lazy or just downright wrong sometimes. Thus, take everything you read here with a grain of salt and don't take things at face value. For example, the paper reviews I post here are done rather quickly and may be downright wrong in some cases. While I put care into checking my blog posts for errors, here I publish as soon as I feel like it and almost never proofread. You've been warned.
